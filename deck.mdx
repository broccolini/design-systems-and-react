# Design Systems at GitHub

---

Design systems are..

# Rules, Principles, & Constraints

---

# implemented in design & code

---

**Rule:** minimum color contrast ratio of 4:5:1

**Constraint:** number of colors in the palette

**Principle:** use color in a meaningful way

# GitHub is 10 years old 🎂

```notes
Some context.
```

# 10 years

of people contributing design and code (debt) 😅

# Ruby on Rails

```notes
and it's a monolith
```

# 🚂  we can't stop the train

```notes
When we formed the design systems team, we couldn't stop everything to build the perfect system.

# Primer CSS

GitHub's design system

---

Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)

Block Element Modifier (BEM)

Functional CSS (Utilities)

---

People no longer had to write much CSS

---

Easier to design in the browser

Styles based on systems worked more harmoniously

# Problems

---

export default QuoteLayout

```html
<div class="bg-gray-light border border-black-fade
rounded p-2 p-md-4 p-lg-6 my-4">
```

```notes
Lots of classes in the markup.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```html
<div class="border p-2 rounded">
  <input class="form-input form-input--large">
  </input>
  <button class="btn btn--primary ml-2">
    Search
  </button>
</div>
```

```notes
Lots of repeated markup
```
---

export default QuoteLayout

```css
.wiki-list {

  em {
    padding: 3px;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 140, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .description {
    margin: 0 0 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    line-height: 20px;
  }

  .wiki-list-item + .wiki-list-item {
    border-top: $border;
  }
}
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```css
.issue-list {

  em {
    padding: 3px;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 140, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .description {
    margin: 0 0 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    line-height: 20px;
  }

  .issue-list-item + .issue-list-item {
    border-top: $border;
  }
}
```

```notes
The only thing that's different is the name of the class selector.
```

There are parts of our code-base we're afraid to touch. One of them is a scss partial named the discussion timeline. It's the source of a huge amount of CSS bugs.

# Presentational components

— Dan Abramov

[Presentational & container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)

---

Presentational components are concerned with _how things look_

```notes
but how do you decide what's a component or not, what props to make available, how to share the
```

---

![](/images/distribute1.png)

```notes
GitHub.com is not the only application or website we maintain.
```

---

![](/images/distribute2.png)

```notes
We want systems to build many websites, that might not always be themed the same, or need the same components.

# Flexibility vs consistency

# Separate structure and skin

— [Nicole Sullivan](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki#separate-structure-and-skin)

---

**Layout:** display, position, padding, margin...

```notes
Layout styles are what controls the structure. These are useful for pretty much every website or application you build. They have no theming or "skin".
```

---

**Common components:** Alert, Button, Label...

```notes
Most web applications need things like Alerts, Buttons, Labels, etc. But marketing websites might not need a lot of these components.
```

---

**Theme:** typography scale, spacing scale, color...

```notes
The theme values are used in both layout and common components. For example you might have a spacing scale for padding and margin. Sometimes sites need to stick closely to the theme, sometimes they won't. Ideally you should be able to swap out the theme and use the same component markup.
```

# Sharing system props

with [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) & [emotion.js](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)

```notes
Alongside CSS from Primer, we started using emotion and styled system to share common system props, like color, spacing, and typography.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// theme.js
{
  "fontSizes": [
    12,
    14,
    16,
    20,
    24,
    32,
    40,
    48
  ]
}
```

```notes
Theme values like typography, spacing, and color are stored in a theme.js file.
```
---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// All components
const Base = system('color', 'space')
```

```jsx
// Typography components
const Text = system('fontSize', 'fontWeight',
'lineHeight')
```

```jsx
// Layout components
const Box = system('display', 'width')
```

```notes
We started off too restrictive with how we shared our system props. Now we've started to create categories of components and they get a common set of props.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
import {Box, Text, Heading} from 'primer-react'

const SiteHero = props => (
  <Box p={[2,4,6]} bg='black' color='white'>
    <Heading fontSize={6}>{props.title}</Heading>
    <Text tag='p'>{props.description}</Text>
  </Box>
)
```

```notes
This offers a lot of flexibility and makes it easy for applications consuming Primer-react to create new components with primer components and system props.
```
