# Design Systems at GitHub

---

Design systems are..

# Rules, Principles, & Constraints

---

# implemented in design & code

---

**Rule:** minimum color contrast ratio of 4:5:1

**Constraint:** number of colors in the palette

**Principle:** use color in a meaningful way

---

An implementation example is the design and code for this flash message

# GitHub is 10 years old 🎂

```notes
Some context.
```

---

# 10 years

of people contributing design and code (debt) 😅

---

# Ruby on Rails

```notes
and it's a monolith
```

---

# 🚂  we can't stop the train

```notes
When we formed the design systems team, we couldn't stop everything to build the perfect system.
```

---

# Primer CSS

GitHub's design system

---

Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)

Block Element Modifier (BEM)

Functional CSS (Utilities)

---

People no longer had to write much CSS

---

Easier to design in the browser

---

Styles based on systems worked more harmoniously

# Problems

---

export default QuoteLayout

```html
<div class="bg-gray-light border border-black-fade
rounded p-2 p-md-4 p-lg-6 my-4">
```

```notes
Lots of classes in the markup.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```html
<div class="border p-2 rounded">
  <input class="form-input form-input--large">
  </input>
  <button class="btn btn--primary ml-2">
    Search
  </button>
</div>
```

```notes
Lots of repeated markup
```
---

export default QuoteLayout

```css
.wiki-list {

  em {
    padding: 3px;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 140, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .description {
    margin: 0 0 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    line-height: 20px;
  }

  .wiki-list-item + .wiki-list-item {
    border-top: $border;
  }
}
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```css
.issue-list {

  em {
    padding: 3px;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 140, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .description {
    margin: 0 0 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    line-height: 20px;
  }

  .issue-list-item + .issue-list-item {
    border-top: $border;
  }
}
```

```notes
The only thing that's different is the name of the class selector.
```

![](/images/discussion-timeline.png)

```notes
There are parts of our code-base we're afraid to touch. One of them is a scss partial named the discussion timeline. It's the source of a huge amount of CSS bugs.

# Primer React

[primer.style/components](https://primer.style/components)

---

📍 start here

```notes
So where did we start.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
import classnames from 'classnames'

const classes = classnames(
  className,
  'State',
  {
    'State--small': small
  }
)
```

```notes
using primer css

# Progress is better than correctness

```notes
Starting with practical, small steps, that help you begin making progress is better than doing what you imagine the perfect solution to be.

# Presentational components

— Dan Abramov

[Presentational & container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)

---

Presentational components are concerned with _how things look_

```notes
We are focussing on presentational components, because that's more important for our design system, we will probably add some container components for things like forms over time.
```

---

![](/images/distribute1.png)

```notes
GitHub.com is not the only application or website we maintain.
```

---

![](/images/distribute2.png)

```notes
We want systems to build many websites, that might not always be themed the same, or need the same components.
```

---
export default QuoteLayout

# Brand on a spectrum

— [Sophie Shepherd](https://speakerdeck.com/sophshep/wrangling-githubs-brand)

```notes
Not all those sites look exactly like GitHub
```

# Flexibility vs consistency

```notes
How do we share styles that let you be consistent with brand and flexible when you need to be?
```

---
export default QuoteLayout

# Separate structure and skin

— [Nicole Sullivan](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki#separate-structure-and-skin)

```notes
Approaches we took with CSS are still relevant to how we approach design systems with React. Same intent, different implementation.
```

---

**Layout:** display, position, padding, margin...

```notes
Layout styles are what controls the structure. These are useful for pretty much every website or application you build. They have no theming or "skin".
```

---

**Common components:** Alert, Button, Label...

```notes
Most web applications need things like Alerts, Buttons, Labels, etc. But marketing websites might not need a lot of these components.
```

---

**Theme:** typography scale, spacing scale, color...

```notes
The theme values are used in both layout and common components. For example you might have a spacing scale for padding and margin. Sometimes sites need to stick closely to the theme, sometimes they won't. Ideally you should be able to swap out the theme and use the same component markup.
```

---

# Sharing system props

with [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) & [emotion.js](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)

```notes
We started to struggle to make primer-react as flexible as we needed it to be. Alongside CSS from Primer, we started using emotion and styled system to share common system props, like color, spacing, and typography.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// theme.js
{
  "fontSizes": [
    12,
    14,
    16,
    20,
    24,
    32,
    40,
    48
  ]
}
```

```notes
Theme values like typography, spacing, and color are stored in a theme.js file.
```
---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// All components
const Base = system('color', 'space')
```

```jsx
// Typography components
const Text = system('fontSize', 'fontWeight',
'lineHeight')
```

```jsx
// Layout components
const Box = system('display', 'width')
```

```notes
We started off too restrictive with how we shared our system props. Now we've started to create categories of components and they get a common set of props.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
import {Box, Text, Heading} from 'primer-react'

const SiteHero = props => (
  <Box p={[2,4,6]} bg='black' color='white'>
    <Heading fontSize={6}>{props.title}</Heading>
    <Text tag='p'>{props.description}</Text>
  </Box>
)
```

```notes
This offers a lot of flexibility and makes it easy for applications consuming Primer-react to create new components with primer components and system props.
```

# Everything is a component

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

```notes
We started to develop some principles, drawing inspiration from things like the Thinking in React documentation
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// this
<BorderBox my={4}>
  <Heading>Hello world</Heading>
</BorderBox>
```

```jsx
// not this
<div className='border rounded p-3 p-md-4 p-lg-6 my-4'>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</div>
```

```notes
Some developers have asked us why not just use heading tags, why use a component?
```

---

![](/images/css-leak.png)

```notes
we don't want to rely on CSS inheritance
```

---

![](/images/encapsulation.png)

```notes
because we want to keep styles encapsulated and reduce the damage one component can do, we want to keep the mess contained
```

# Minimal API surface area

— [Sebastián Markbage](https://youtu.be/4anAwXYqLG8)

```notes
many folks won't read the documentation, we want developers to be able to quickly learn how to use the design system
```

---

# Re-use patterns

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// System props
<Box p={3} bg='blue.2' color='blue.9' />
<Text mb={2} color='red.5' />
```

```jsx

// Scheme props
<Label scheme='red' />
<Flash scheme='green' />
```

# Watch out for the apropcalypse

— [@gurlcode](https://speakerdeck.com/jenncreighton/flexible-architecture-for-react-components?slide=11)

---

![](/images/apropcalypse.png)

---

Maybe it should be another component?

---

# Design the public API before you build it

aka readme-driven development

```notes
show what the end result should look like, it's much easier to clearly define goals and have conversations this way 
```
